  Given a single section of a Markdown document, generate a structured JSON output for that section.
  Step-by-Step Instructions:
  1. Identify Subsections: Within the provided section, use heading levels (e.g., H2, H3) or logical relationships to identify subsections, at least 1 subsection should be extracted.
  2. Extract Titles and Content: generate concise (<= 5 words) and appropriate titles based on content. Ensure the content is complete and not truncated.
  3. Process Content:
    - Retain all original text as provided, and ensure the most important content is retained without truncation.
  4. Extract Available Metadata: Extract available metadata (e.g., title, author, publish date, organization, etc.) from the section’s content or context; include only the keys for which data is present.
  5. Generate Summary: Generate a concise summary of the section, less than 100 words.

  {
      "title": "Section 1",
      "summary": "summary of the section, less than 100 words",
      "subsections": [
          {
              "title": "Subsection 1.1",
              "content": "content of subsection 1.1"

              "content": "content"
          }
